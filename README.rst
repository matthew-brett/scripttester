ScriptTester - utility for testing command line scripts
#######################################################

.. shared-text-body

**********
Quickstart
**********

Provides class to be instantiated in tests that check that scripts can be run
and give correct output.  Usually works something like this in a test module::

    import mymodule
    from scripttester import ScriptTester
    runner = ScriptTester(mymodule)

Then, in the tests, something like::

    code, stdout, stderr = runner.run_command(['my-script', my_arg])
    assert code == 0
    assert stdout == b'This script ran OK'

The class aims to find your scripts whether you have installed (with ``pip
install .`` or ``pip install -e .`` or ``python setup.py install``), or not.
If you have not installed, the scripts will not be on your system PATH, and we
have to find them.  The heuristic is to look (by default) in the directory
containing ``mymodule``; if there is a ``setup.py`` file there, and a
``scripts`` sub-directory, assume that directory contains the scripts.

Note there is no way of using this not-installed mechanism to find entrypoint
scripts, that have not been installed. To find these, we would have to run the
``setup.py`` file.
